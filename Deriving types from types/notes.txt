typeof
Using this we can get the typeof and predefined object and function

keyof
Used to get the keys of any type as the type
While using keyof, after keyof we need to specify another type where we need to abstract keys

mapped type
simple way of converting one object type to another type
we can do more than mapping while using mapped types, i.e making property optional and vice versa
we can also make mapped fields readonly
