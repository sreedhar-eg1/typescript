When we access the site we can see lots of http request in netork tab (while not using webpack)
problem here is every http request takes some time to download,
it will take some time to setup the request and send it, can be noticed in network tab, a white box before request timeline

so we can use webpack, a bundling tool
we can bundle the code and theredore there will be less http request to be made which will increase the performance

usage of webpack
bundles the code, less imports are rerquired
optimized code, less code to download


WEBPACK INSTALLATION
npm i -D webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server typescript ts-loader

webpack => used to bundle code and also for optimaization and transform our code
webpack-cli => to run webpack command in our project
webpack-dev-server => to have built in development server, watches for changes and tell webpack to recompile when something changes
ts-loader => works along with webpack, tells how to convert typescript code to javascript

changes to be made in tscongfig.ts file
rootDir is not required as webpack take care of this

Add a new config file called webpak.config.js file
This is the file webpack automaticaaly look for

here we need to specify the entry point of the application, and all import should not contains any extension
entry: '...

also need to specify output, which is an object

we also need to tell, how the import are handled, which can be done using module object

there is an resolve object, where we can say, which file extension should be added if it encounter any import specified in
module object rules

In ts.config file, set sourcemap to true, which helps in debugging
in turn in webpack config file, use devtool: 'inline-source-map',
tells source map file will be generated already, extract it and wire up correctly to the bundle

After you have done with webpack configuration, next thing is how to use it
we can use it by creating a script in package json file
"build": "webpack"

for production, we need different workflow, so we need another webpack.config.js file
i.e webpack.config.prod.js, whereas webpack.config.js file will ne looked automaticaaly by webpack
