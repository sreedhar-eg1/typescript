decorator executes when our class is defined, not after it has been instantiated

decorator factory
it returns the decorator function, but allows us to configure it when we assign it as a decorator
when we are using decorator factory, then we need to execute the function instead of pointing

we can add more than one decorator to class, method or field
order of execution of decorator is from bottom to top

here the order will be @withTemplate => @logger
@logger("Logging decorator factory")
@withTemplate("<h1>My Person Object</h1>", "app")


Order of decorator execute
All decorator runs without instantiating the class

we can return while using decorator, if we return something, then it works only when we instantiate
we can return something only for class, method and accessor
