Using typescript with javascript libraries
If we need to use the package that was completely written in javascript in our typescript project
we will get error stating "Could not find a declaration file for module 'lodash'" last will be package name

solution for such problem is to install @types dependency related to the dependency that we are facing issue
Ex for loadash package: npm i --save-dev @types/lodash
