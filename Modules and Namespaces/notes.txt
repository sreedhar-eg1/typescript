we can make use of namespace to split code
with export keyword, it can be accessed outside

inside namespace we can add anything, like class, interface....
we need to provide name for the namespace

We can import namespace in another file using ///
for ex, /// <reference path="drag-and-drop.ts" />
we can give same name for the namespace across multiple files 

namespace exists only in typescript world, its not available in javascript
so to solve this, in tsconfig file, use "outFile": "./dist/bundle.js"
to this to work, we need to set module to amd in tsconfig file
