To create a TS config file
run tsc --init

a new file called tsconfig.json file will be created, which is used to configure typescript behavior


target -> how the project is compiled
If the user uses latest modern browser, then we can use latest version like es2024... otherwise use es2016

lib -> If we want to include any type library, than we can include inside lib array

module => how import and export should work

rootDir -> If the src file is situated in some other location, then we can point it to that location with the help of rootDir


JAVASCRIPT SUPPORT
allowJS -> if we set this to true, then we can have a combination of javascript and typescript

checkJS -> to enable basic type checking in javascript file


EMIT
sourcemap => If it is set to true, then it generates source map, which helps in debugging

outDir => we can specify the location where our compiled file should stay

noEmitOnError => If we set it to true, if any error occurs in ts file, corresponding JS file is not generated while compiling
