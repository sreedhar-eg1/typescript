Decorator
It is a metaprogramming
Code that interact with other code

Two types of decorator
1. ECMAscript decorator
    Built into javascript
    Can be used without typescript

2. Experimental decorator
    previously planned implementation
    Did not make it into javascript
    Only supported by typescript
    requires "experimentalDecorators" configuration

Both types of decorator can be used with typescript

decorator in javacript are just function

For ECMAscript decorator function we need to pass two argument
we declare decorator infront of class or above useing @ symbol

we can use decorator to change things

type for class => new () => any

we can have method decorator also
method decorator are executed before class decorator
